We were sitting on the beach.
The waves were a soft background to the moment, a cold drink in my hand, the weather was perfect - I never want to leave this moment.
Water and foam called us, we answered. Peace is a rare thing, take advantage of the moment. We swam until the waves pulled us up, maybe it was dangerous.
All the sudden, I couldn't see her. She was somewhere else, I'd lost her...
Where is she? Where was she?
