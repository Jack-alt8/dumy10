        We were sitting on the beach.
        The waves were a soft background to the moment, a cold drink in my hand, the weather was perfect - I never want to
        leave this moment.
        Water and foam called us, we answered. Peace is a rare thing, take advantage of the moment. We swam until the waves
        pulled us up, maybe it was dangerous.
        All the sudden, I couldn't see her. She was somewhere else, I'd lost her...
        Where is she? Where was she?
        I felt a pull on my leg, and there she was right under me, she had swam down to scare me.
        She came up and said, "Got you!"
        We walked back to the car, and laughed while we drove off, we've got to pace ourselves.
        Then we drove to get tacos, and watched the sunset.
